# estimating-dopaminergic-clusters-valences
This is a script that uses the expression table and the data from the Ymazes (but also thought for the data from the T-mazes) to estimate the effect of the activation of dopaminergic neuronal clusters.
The first two scripts are older versions which do not work so well. The final version is the modelling_scores.Rmd. The powerpoint presentation might help to understand and introduce the scripts
